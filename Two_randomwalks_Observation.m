% A simple yet insightful look at random walks %

% A simple comparison between two random walks with two differenct
%probability distribuitions.

% The First Random Walk is performed according to white noise with Normal Distribution with variance 1

% The Second Random Walk performed with the white noise component with a  Uniform distribution with variance 1
% The two distributions are taken to have the same varience so we can
% extract a useful comparison
